Greetings! Glad you found this site from the vast ocean of the internet. Here's my solutions for CS61B 2021 spring semester. It isn't perfect, and a lot of it references other people's code. But at least I wrote the whole thing and can promise you all the code passes autograder for 2021. 

Regarding proj2 : gitlet, I didn't finish it perfectly. the extra score for status and the remote control is not done, merge should have issues that will reflect on status. I will finish this project completely later when I have time, right now this code gets a perfect score but it's not good enough, so please be aware of that if you want to refer to it. 

I know the code shouldn't just be out in the open, and what's worse is that I actually know current CS61B (CS61BL in 2024 summer) is still using these projects. But I'm not disclosing this out of rebellion (although there is a bit of that). It's just that I wanted to ask a friend to debug my final project, and that necessitated making this repo public, so there's it. I don't think there's anything wrong with referencing, as long as you're not copying it all, what matters most is what you learn.

Anyway, have fun and never lose sleep. Bye!
